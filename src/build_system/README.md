what do i need?
building and running
building, its a dag
we have a bunch of commands / rules
each instance has input files and output files (and how to actually run it)
{ "input_files": [], "output_files": ["/tmp/foo"], "command": ["touch", "/tmp/foo"]}
compilation would be a bit more complex, you depend on a bunch of compiler files
a rule is stale if any input file if younger than any output file
or if an output file is missing
TOOD: is staleness good? might want something better
most rules would have a single output file
TODO: what does input file being a directory mean?
i also need to enforce truth of input_files and output_files

an output file is generated by a rule
if the rule changes -> rebuild
if input files change (by mtime) -> rebuild
input files dont have to exist, std::optional<mtime>

where do rules come from?
