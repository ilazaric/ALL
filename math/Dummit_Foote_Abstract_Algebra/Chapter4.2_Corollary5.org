* Corollary 5

Claim:
If $G$ is a finite group of order $n$ and $p$ is the smallest prime dividing $\#G$,
then any subgroup of index $p$ is normal.

** $p^2$ version
First we prove a special claim:
If $G$ is of size $p^2$, where $p$ is prime, $G$ is commutative.
( either $C_{p^2}$ or ${C_p}^2$ )

Suppose $G$ has an element $g$ of order $p^2$
Then $G$ is obviously $C_{p^2}$
Otherwise, order of each nontrivial element has to be $p$

Consider the following partition of $G \setminus 1$
$F = \left\{ \left\{ g^i \mid 1 \leq i \leq p-1 \right\} \mid g \in G \setminus 1 \right\}$
Each element of $F$ is of size exactly $p-1$
$\#F = p+1$

Consider the action of $G$ on $F$ via conjugation
$g f = g \cdot f \cdot g^{-1} = \{{g}{h}{g^{-1}} \mid h \in f\}$
Easy to verify it is well defined
Representation of $G$ action are permutations on $F$, a $p+1$ size set
Since each non-trivial $g \in G$ is of order $p$ ,
the corresponding permutation is either of order $p$ or $1$

*** $\exists~g \neq 1 \in G$ such that the action permutation is trivial

Let $h \neq 1 \in G$ such that $g$ and $h$ are not in the same $F$ partition.
Obviously $\langle g \rangle \langle h \rangle = G$

Action being trivial means:
$g \langle h \rangle = \langle h \rangle$
$\exists~i \in \mathbb{N}: g h g^{-1} = h^i$
Consider the expression $g^p h g^{-p}$
$h = g^p h h^{-p} = h^{i^p}$
$1 = h^{i^p - 1}$
$i^p \equiv i \pmod{p}$
$1 = h^{i-1}$
$i = 1$
Therefore, $g$ and $h$ commute, so $G$ is ${C_p}^2$

*** $\forall~g \neq 1 \in G$ action permutation is of order $p$

Enumerate $F$ elements: $f_i : 1 \leq i \leq p+1$
Consider action permutations as elements of $S_{p+1}$
Every element $g \neq 1 \in G$ fixes $\langle g \rangle$
There are $p$ leftover points to act on
Since the order is $p$ the permutation has to be a full cycle
Also note that for every $1 \leq 1 \leq p+1$, there are
elements in $G$ which have $i$ as fixed point for permutation
(elements of $f_i$)

Take an element $g \neq 1 \in G$
WLOG the permutation is $(2 \; 3 \; 4 \; ... \; p \; p+1)$
(with $1$ being fixed point)
Take an element $h \neq 1 \in G$ which has $p+1$ as fixed point
permutation of h: $(1=h_0 \; h_1 \; h_2 \; ... \; h_{p-1})$
$h$ maps $h_i$ onto $h_{i+1}$ (modulo $p$)

$gh^i$ has to have a fixed point $\forall~ 1 \leq i \leq p-1$
All fixed points are different
They are also different from fixed points of $g$ and $h$
(which are $1$ and $p+1$)
So the set of the fixed points is $\{2, 3, ..., p\}$

$\exists~j : gh^i (h_j) = g(h_{i+j})$
If $h_{i+j}=1$, $g$ maps it on $1$, so $h_j=1$, impossible
Also, $h_{i+j} \neq p+1$
So $h_{i+j} \in \{2, 3, ..., p\}$

So $g$ will just increment the value
We are searching for solutions to $h_{i+j}+1 = h_j$
For every $i$ there has to be exactly one $j$
Note all $h_j$ have to be different
Also, all $h_{i+j}$ have to be different
Summing all $p-1$ equations we get:
$H + p-1 = H$, contradiction

** continuing

Suppose $H \leq G$, $|G : H| = p$
Consider double cosets $HgH$
From previous exercises (4.2-10-(d,e)) we know:
$|HgH| = |H| \cdot |H : H \cap g^{-1} H g|$
Note $|H : H \cap g^{-1}Hg| \Big| |H| = \dfrac{n}{p}$
So the index is either $1$ or at least $p$
Assume it's not $1$ because otherwise it is normal

$n = |G| \geq |HgH| = \dfrac{n}{p} \cdot |...| \geq \dfrac{n}{p} \cdot p = n$
But double cosets partition $G$
Yet $HgH = G$
contradiction

seems $p^2$ version was useless ...
