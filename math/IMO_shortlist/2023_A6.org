* Task

$k \geq 2$ is an integer
Find all sequences $a_i \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
exists monic polynomial $P$ of degree $k$ , non-negative coefs,
such that $P(a_n) = a_{n+1} a_{n+2} \dots a_{n+k}$
for every $n \geq 1$

* Exploration

** $P$ is strictly increasing

Obvious

** $a_{n+k+1} = \dfrac{a_{n+1}P(a_{n+1})}{P(a_n)}$

$P(a_n) = a_{n+1} \dots a_{n+k}$
$P(a_{n+1}) = a_{n+2} \dots a_{n+k+1}$
$\dfrac{a_{n+1}P(a_{n+1})}{P(a_n)} = \dfrac{a_{n+1} a_{n+2} \dots a_{n+k+1}}{a_{n+1} \dots a_{n+k}} = a_{n+k+1}$

** $a_n \leq a_{n+1}$

Assume opposite: $\exists~n \colon a_n > a_{n+1}$
Then $P(a_n) > P(a_{n+1})$
So $a_{n+k+1} = a_{n+1} \cdot \dfrac{P(a_{n+1})}{P(a_n)} < a_{n+1}$
So there is a $n+1 \leq l < n+k+1$ such that $a_l > a_{l+1}$ and $a_{n+1} > a_{l+1}$

because:
start with $l = n+k$, it satisfies 2nd inequality
if it doesn't satisfy 1st: $a_l \leq a_{l+1} < a_{n+1}$
therefore decrementing $l$ preserves 2nd inequality
Suppose we reached $l = n+1$ and still 1st is not satisfied
So we have not 1st: $a_{n+1} \leq a_{n+2}$ and 2nd: $a_{n+1} > a_{n+2}$
Contradiction

So we prove that, if $a_n > a_{n+1}$, that there is an $l$ such that
the same inequality holds, and $a_{n+1} > a_{l+1}$
Since the naturals are well ordered, this is a contradiction

** $a_n = a_{n+1} = c \implies a_i = c~\forall~i \geq n$

$a_{n+k+1} = \dfrac{a_{n+1}P(a_{n+1})}{P(a_n)} = a_{n+1} = c$
$c = a_n \leq a_{n+k} \leq a_{n+k+1} = c$
Therefore $a_i = c~\forall~i \geq n$

** $a_n = a_{n+1} = c \implies a_i = c~\forall~i \in \mathbb{N}$

Suppose $n \neq 1$
$P(c) = P(a_n) = a_{n+1} \dots a_{n+k} = c^k$
$P(a_{n-1}) = a_n \dots a_{n+k-1} = c^k$
$P$ is strictly increasing, therefore $a_{n-1} = c$

** Solving $a_n < a_{n+1}~\forall~n \in \mathbb{N}$

$P(x) = x^k + c_{k-1}x^{k-1} + \dots + c_1x + c_0$
$L = a_2 \dots a_{k+1} = P(a_1) > c_0 + \dots + c_{k-1}$
Therefore $P(x) < x^k + Lx^{k-1}$
$a_n^k + La_n^{k-1} > P(a_n) = a_{n+1} \dots a_{n+k} > a_n^k + a_n^{k-1} \cdot (a_{n+1} + \dots + a_{n+k} - ka_n)$
$L > a_{n+1} + \dots + a_{n+k} - ka_n \geq a_{n+1} - a$
Consecutive differences are bounded!

Consider $n$ such that $a_n$ is big enough
Since $P(a_n) = a_{n+1} \dots a_{n+k}$
We conclude $P(x) = (x + a_{n+1} - a_n) \dots (x + a_{n+k} - a_n)$
Which is uniquely determined by $\{a_{n+1} - a_n, \dots, a_{n+k} - a_n\}$ sequence
Consider $n+1$
We conclude $a_{n+2} - a_{n+1} = a_{n+1} - a_n$
Therefore $a_i = xi + y$ for $i > n$
And $P(t) = (t+x) \dots (t+kx)$
$P(a_n) = a_{n+1} \dots a_{n+k}$
$(a_n+x) \dots (a_n + kx) = (x(n+1)+y) \dots (x(n+k)+y)$
Therefore $x(n+1)+y \geq x+1$
Therefore $xn+y \geq 1$
$a_n = xn + y$ is unique solution
So we fill it up until $n=1$
$a_i = xi + y$

** Unsorted


$a_n < a_{n+1}$
$P(a_n) \geq (a_n+1) \dots (a_n+k)$


$a_i = c$ works, $P(x) = x^k$

$a_i = xi + y$ works I think
$P(t) = (t+x)(t+2x)\dots(t+kx)$


$P(a_n) - P(a_{n+1}) = a_{n+2}\dots a_{n+k} \cdot (a_{n+1} - a_{n+k+1})$
$P(x) - P(y) = (x-y)Q(x,y)$


$P(a_n)a_{n+k+1} = a_{n+1}\dots a_{n+k+1} = a_{n+1} P(a_{n+1})$
$a_{n+k+1} = \dfrac{a_{n+1}P(a_{n+1})}{P(a_n)}$


$k=2$
$P(x) = x^2 + ax + b \colon a,b \in \mathbb{N}_0$
$P(a_n) = a_{n+1} a_{n+2}$

$a_2 = \dfrac{P(a_0)}{a_1} = \dfrac{a_0^2 + aa_0 + b}{a_1}$

$a_{n+2} = \dfrac{P(a_n)}{a_{n+1}}$
$a_{n+3} = \dfrac{P(a_{n+1})}{a_{n+2}} = \dfrac{P(a_{n+1})a_{n+1}}{P(a_n)}$

$P(x) \geq x^2$


$a_0^2 + aa_0 + b = a_1a_2$
$a_1^2 + aa_1 + b = a_2a_3$
$a(a_0 - a_1) = a_1a_2 - a_2a_3 + a_1^2 - a_0^2$
Suppose $a_0 \neq a_1$
$a = \dfrac{a_1a_2 - a_2a_3}{a_0-a_1} - a_0 - a_1$


Suppose $a_i$ is good
Then $b_i = ca_i$ is good due to $P_b(x) = x^2 + acx + bc^2$
Because $P_b(b_n) = c^2P_a(a_n) = c^2a_{n+1}a_{n+2} = b_{n+1}b_{n+2}$

Is $b_i = a_i+1$ good?
$a' = \dfrac{b_1b_2 - b_2b_3}{b_0 - b_1} - b_0 - b_1$
$a' = \dfrac{a_1a_2 + a_1 + a_2 + 1 - a_2a_3 - a_2 - a_3 - 1}{a_0 - a_1} - a_0 - a_1 - 2$
$a' = \dfrac{a_1a_2 - a_2a_3 + a_1 - a_3}{a_0 - a_1} - a_0 - a_1 - 2$
$a' = a + \dfrac{a_1 - a_3}{a_0 - a_1} - 2$
Dunno


Suppose $a_0 = a_1 = a_2 =  c$
$P(c) = c^2$
$a_{n+2} = \dfrac{P(a_n)}{a_{n+1}}$
Induction says $a_n = c~\forall~n \in \mathbb{N}$
