* Task

$E_k(n) = \text{how many times is n! divisible by k}$
Show:
(a) infinitely many $n$ such that $E_{10}(n) > E_9(n)$
(B) infinitely many $n$ such that $E_{10}(n) < E_9(n)$

* Exploration

$E_{10} = E_5$
$E_9(n) = \left\lfloor \dfrac{E_3(n)}{2} \right\rfloor$

$E_p(n) = \dfrac{n - d_p(n)}{p - 1}$
Where $d_p(n) = \text{sum of digits of n in base p}$

$E_{10}(n) = E_5(n) = \dfrac{n - d_5(n)}{4}$
$E_9(n) = \left\lfloor \dfrac{n - d_3(n)}{4} \right\rfloor$

this is obvious
why am i solving this garbage
why is this N3
