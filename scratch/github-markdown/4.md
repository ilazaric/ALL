# Leaf blocks

## Thematic breaks

probably shouldn't use `---` bc can be interpreted as setext heading
   * * * * * * * * *
`***` or `___` it is then
___
at most 3 spaces before it, can have spaces anywhere inside, at least 3 occurences of the character

- list1
- list2
- ***
- list3

## ATX headings

they are the titles, 1-6 `#` then space then whatever, suffix `#`-es are removed

***
# l1
## l2
### l3
#### l4
##### l5
###### l6
***

## Setext headings

hello  
world  
bla  
truc
foo
---

bla
bla  
truc
truc
===

a
---
b
---

## Indented code blocks

    hello
    world
    
dont think i care about this, since i have triple backticks

## Fenced code blocks

These are the (at least) triple backticks, GOAT  
Apparently you can use triple tildes as well  
Basically everything can be indented up to 3 spaces  
After starting triple backticks you can add an info string  
Like `~~~cpp`  


```
hello
world

world
hello
```

```cpp
int main() {
  return 123;
}
```

Indentation of starting backticks removes some indention of the code

  ```
  bla
    truc
      foo
znj
```

```python
import argparse
def fn(x):
  pass
```

A bit unclear how github treats info strings though

## HTML blocks

Oof, don't think I care about this one ATM, good to be aware of it in future though

## Link reference definitions

This will be good

Following doesn't work really

[goog1]: google.com 'this is google'

[goog1]

[goog2]: www.google.com 'this is google'

[goog2]

But this one works:

[goog3]: https://www.google.com 'this is google'

[goog3]

[HTML]: /#HTML%20blocks whatever

[HTML]

Hmm, dunno how to link to a section within same doc

## Paragraphs

Not much to say, two spaces at end of a line add a line break

This
is
without
spaces
at
end

This  
is  
with  
spaces  
at  
end  

## Blank lines

nothing

## Tables (extension)

| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| - | - | - |
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
| a | b | c |
| x | y | z |

| --left-- | --center-- | --right-- |
| :------- | :--------: | --------: |
| a        | b          | c         |
